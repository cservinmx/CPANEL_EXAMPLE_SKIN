cPanel, Inc. provides this skeleton style to help you to develop custom styles that modify the appearance of the cPanel interface. For example, you may wish to create a customized appearance to match your company's branding and logo, or you may wish to create customized styles for distribution.

We strongly recommend that you do not attempt to modify the existing cPanel default style. Updates to cPanel & WHM may overwrite your changes. To modify any aspect of the cPanel interface's appearance, you must create a new style. 

Style development workflow:
When you create a cPanel style with this skeleton style, we recommend that you use the following workflow:
1. Update the styles.css file to contain the desired CSS alterations.
2. Add the desired images and other assets. 
  - Store custom icons in the icons directory with the same filename and extension as the icon that you wish to replace. For a list of icon filenames, visit http://go.cpanel.net/appkey
  - Store the style's 500x500 preview image as the preview.png file within the style's directory.
  - Store sprites and associated CSS files in the sprites directory.
3. Use WHM's Customization interface (Home >> cPanel >> Customization) to upload the style, or move the style's directory to the appropriate location on the server:
For all of the accounts on the server — /var/cpanel/customizations/styled/mystyle/
For all of the cPanel accounts that a reseller owns — /home/reseller/var/cpanel/reseller/styled/mystyle/
For a specific cPanel account — /home/username/var/cpanel/styled/mystyle/
If these directories do not currently exist on the server, use the mkdir command to create them.
4. Apply the style to the desired accounts.
